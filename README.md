# popular_music_analysis
The current analysis aims to provide insights on the changes in musical features and song lyrics in American popular music from 1950 to 2015, based on openly published dataset extracted from Billboardâ€™s Hot 100 and the Spotify API. 

Two research questions are addressed in the analysis using R: (1) how has American popular music changed in terms of musical features, and (2) how has American popular music changed in terms of song lyrics.
